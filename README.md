# Reuse-vape-by-mouth reference manual

## About
Ciao! This project was born to reduce the environmental problem: **single-use vapes are extremely polluting waste.** To achieve this, the idea is to create an automated disassembly process. Anyone using this process will need a machine, which we will design together!

### Why do they pollute so much?
  - Disposable vapes contain batteries but are often disposed of in common waste.
  - Manufacturers generally recommend treating such waste as electronic waste, but this is not enough because these objects are made of various plastic and metal materials.
  - The companies responsible for disposing of the parts store them because dismantling them would need to be done manually. It seems impossible for someone to dismantle disposable vapes manually.
  - Vapes are not standardized, which makes it more challenging to establish recycling processes.
  - There is limited data on production, updated to 2017, which makes it impossible to quantify the effects on waste generation in subsequent years.
  - Products that become waste once exhausted are currently not being tracked.

## L'opportunità con questo progetto:
  - dare la possibilità alle persone di fare piccole azioni con grande impatto sulla filiera del riciclo
  - essere ispirazione per progetti più innovativi

  ### The beginning:  
  The project was inspired by a [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btRH-XuQyNg&list=PL70d3FNwaXdb6OqJ9qJQBi_TLikRECbJ5&index=5) I watched on Swiss TV. It deeply moved me and made me question whether I could contribute something meaningful to the environment.

## To do list:
- [ ] Creation of a machine that can be easily replicated in a laboratory by DIY enthusiasts. Maybe with 3D printing methods.
- [ ] Creation of clear instructions, guidelines to contribute to the project.
- [ ] Create a section named "where to help" and another section "contacts".

## Contribute documentation
Anyone can contribute. Your help is most welcome!
